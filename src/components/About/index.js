        Welcome to my portfolio! I'm thrilled to have you here. As a recent Full Stack Developer Bootcamp Graduate, I'm eager to embark on an exciting journey in the tech sales arena. But let me tell you, my path here has been quite an adventure!

        In the past, I've grown  in various fields, each one adding a unique layer to my diverse skillset. From exploring the artistry of culinary delights to delving into the complexities of business administration, I've had the pleasure of wearing different hats and learning valuable lessons along the way.</p>

  Beyond the kitchen and office, my passion for health and well-being led me to become a certified lactation specialist and delve into the world of public health nutrition. These experiences have given me a deep appreciation for the human element in technology and how it can transform lives for the better.

Now, as I set my sights on the tech sales world, I'm excited to combine my technical knowledge and cross-disciplinary expertise. I'm on the lookout for a cutting-edge organization that values innovation, growth, and making a positive impact on the world.

Join me as I strive to bring my diverse background, creativity, and determination to contribute to a forward-thinking team. Let's shape a brighter future together!

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I hope we can connect and explore new possibilities soon. Don't hesitate to reach outâ€”I'm always up for a good conversation or collaboration.

Let's make an impact together!
